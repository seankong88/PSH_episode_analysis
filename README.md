# PSH Episode Analysis

This is the source code for paper: Computational Frameworks for Real-Time Detection of Paroxysmal Sympathetic Hyperactivity among Traumatic Brain Injury Patients

## 🌟 Highlights

- This is the source code of our computational frameworks for modeling and detecting PSH using densely sampled physiological VS data collected from bedside monitors.
- We explored two artificial intelligence (AI) methods utilizing annotated data to automatically detect PSH episodes from high resolution VS data:
  * Manually derived expert system (ES) based approach
  * Machine learning (ML) model approach


## ℹ️ Overview

Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) occurs in a large subset of critically ill
traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients and is associated with complications and poor
recovery. It is defined by otherwise unexplained recurrent episodic vital sign elevations.
Standard diagnostic criteria rely heavily on subjective judgment, leading to challenges
and delays in recognition, monitoring, and management. The aim of this study was to
develop automated PSH detection and quantification tools that exclusively utilize
bedside continuous vital sign data. Using a cohort of 221 critically ill acute TBI patients
with at least 14 days of continuous vital sign data (of which 107 were clinically
diagnosed with PSH) we developed two artificial intelligence-based episode detection methods including an expert system approach and a machine
learning model approach. All three methods demonstrate initial face validity to
delineate PSH cases from non-PSH TBI controls. Implementation of these methods as
real-time clinical decision support tools could improve the standard monitoring and
management of this challenging syndrome.
