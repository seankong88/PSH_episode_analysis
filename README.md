# PSH Episode Analysis

This is the source code for paper: Computational Frameworks for Real-Time Detection of Paroxysmal Sympathetic Hyperactivity among Traumatic Brain Injury Patients

## 🌟 Highlights

- This is the source code of our computational frameworks for modeling and detecting PSH using densely sampled physiological VS data collected from bedside monitors.
- We explored two artificial intelligence (AI) methods utilizing annotated data to automatically detect PSH episodes from high resolution VS data:
  * Manually derived expert system (ES) based approach
  * Machine learning (ML) model approach
